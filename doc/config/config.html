  <h1 class="topictitle1">Server Configuration</h1>
  <p class="description">The CoAP server configuration contains attributes defining the CoAP endpoint and child elements that define CoAP
resources that will be served. Add resources by adding "&lt;coap-server:resource&gt;" child-elements to the "&lt;coap-server:config&gt;" element.
The resources can - in turn - contain other resources. This hierarchy of resources defines the CoAP ReST interface.
Every resource element defines its name and the operations that are available on it. The operations on resources possible are Get, Post, Put, Delete and Observe.
When the EarlyAck flag is set an acknowledgement is immediately sent back to the client, before processing the request and returning the response.
Use this when processing takes longer than the acknowledgment-timeout of the client.
Clients can refer to resources by their path in the hierarchy e.g. "/root/child", where the resource named "root" contains the resource named "child".
The size and type attributes can be added to resources which will be reported to clients when they issue a Discovery request.</p>
